## About

welk is a cross-platform flashcard application written in Compose Multiplatform, currently in development. 

## Development prerequisites

For local development:
- the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file should be placed into the `iosApp/iosApp` directory.
- the `firebase.properties` file should be placed into the directory `shared/src/jvmMain/resources` with the following configuration:
  ```properties
  # Firebase configuration
  firebase.apiKey=
  firebase.authDomain=
  firebase.projectId=
  firebase.storageBucket=
  firebase.messagingSenderId=
  firebase.appId=
  ```

## Code Quality Tools

This project uses the following code quality tools:

### detekt
Static code analysis for Kotlin. Configuration is in `detekt.yaml`.

```bash
# Run detekt analysis on all modules
./gradlew detekt

# Run detekt on specific targets
./gradlew shared:detektJvmMain
./gradlew composeApp:detektDesktopMain
```

### ktlint
Code formatting and style checking for Kotlin. Configuration is in `.editorconfig`.

```bash
# Check code formatting
./gradlew ktlintCheck

# Auto-format code
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

## Roadmap
